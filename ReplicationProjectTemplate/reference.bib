	abstract = {Despite their strong positive average returns across numerous asset classes, momentum strategies can experience infrequent and persistent strings of negative returns. These momentum crashes are partly forecastable. They occur in panic states, following market declines and when market volatility is high, and are contemporaneous with market rebounds. The low ex ante expected returns in panic states are consistent with a conditionally high premium attached to the option like payoffs of past losers. An implementable dynamic momentum strategy based on forecasts of momentum’s mean and variance approximately doubles the alpha and Sharpe ratio of a static momentum strategy and is not explained by other factors. These results are robust across multiple time periods, international equity markets, and other asset classes.},

However, momentum has also had the worst crashes, making the strategy unappealing to investors who dislike negative skewness and kurtosis. We find that the risk of momentum is highly variable over time and predictable. Managing this risk virtually eliminates crashes and nearly doubles the Sharpe ratio of the momentum strategy. Risk-managed momentum is a much greater puzzle than the original version.},

(2) A betting against beta (BAB) factor, which is long leveraged low-beta assets and short high-beta assets, produces significant positive riskadjusted returns. (3) When funding constraints tighten, the return of the BAB factor is low. (4) Increased funding liquidity risk compresses betas toward one. (5) More constrained investors hold riskier assets.},

The value premium decreases with ﬁrm size and is weak among the largest stocks. Momentum proﬁts, however, exhibit no reliable relation with size. These effects are robust over 86 years of US equity data and almost 40 years of data across four international equity markets and ﬁve asset classes. Variation over time and across markets of these effects is consistent with random chance. We ﬁnd little evidence that size, value, and momentum returns are signiﬁcantly affected by changes in trading costs or institutional and hedge fund ownership over time.},

A comparison of statistical analysis of data in a benchmark and experiment results of Monero mining was conducted. Thereafter, this study provided an estimation of global electricity consumption of the Monero mining activity. The results indicated that the hashing algorithm mainly determines the mining efﬁciency. Data analysis and experiments and estimated Monero mining electricity consumption in the world and its carbon emission in China as a case study. In 2018, Monero mining may consume 645.62 GWh of electricity in the world after its hard fork. The Monero mining in China may consume 30.34 GWh and contribute a carbon emission of 19.12e19.42 thousand tons from April to December in 2018. Although cryptocurrency mining and blockchain technology are promising, their inﬂuence on energy conversation and sustainable development should be further studied.},

After decomposing those nine long-short factor portfolios, we notice that their dominance relative to above four benchmarks and equity portfolios based on size, momentum and book-to-market, is mainly attributable to their long legs. A three-factor cryptocurrency model (market, size, and momentum) has insignificant alphas for five of the dominant cryptocurrency portfolios, indicating that their dominance is due to a risk premium. We then add the combinations of four mispricing factors and cryptocurrency fundamental factors to the three-factor model. The alphas of the other four dominant cryptocurrency portfolios remain significant, indicating that their dominance is due to mispricing.},

In this study, price prediction is performed with two machine learning methods, namely linear regression (LR) and support vector machine (SVM), by using a time series consisting of daily ether cryptocurrency closing prices. Different window lengths are used in ether cryptocurrency price prediction by using filters with different weight coefficients. In the training phase, a cross-validation method is used to construct a high-performance model independent of the data set. The proposed model is implemented using two machine learning techniques. When using the proposed model, the SVM method has a higher accuracy (96.06\%) than the LR method (85.46\%). Furthermore, the accuracy score of the proposed model can be increased up to 99\% by adding features to the SVM method.},
